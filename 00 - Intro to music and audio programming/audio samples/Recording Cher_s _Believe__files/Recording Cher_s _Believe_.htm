      <P><FONT face=arial,helvetica size=4>It was the best-selling single of 
      last year, and signalled a radical change of musical direction for Cher --

      align=right>For most of last year, it looked as though Celine Dion's track 
      'My Heart Will Go On' was going to be the best-selling single of 1998 -- 
      but this accolade was snatched from the Canadian Queen of AOR at the 11th 
      hour by another female vocalist who not only launched a successful 
      challenge for the title, but did so with a song that was massively 
      different from anything she had ever done before.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT face=arial,helvetica>For those of you who've been stuck on a 
      radio-less desert island for the last two months, the single in question 
      is Cher's dance hit, 'Believe', which spent seven weeks at the top of the 
      UK charts and -- at the time of going to press -- had already achieved 
      sales of 1.5 million and rising. What's less well-known is that it was 
      produced by two London-based producers Mark Taylor and Brian Rawling, in 
      their own studio.</FONT></P>

      <P class=smallredtext>Cher's 'Believe' (Dec 1998) was the first commercial 
      recording to feature the audible side-effects of Antares 
      <EM>Auto-tune</EM> software used as a deliberate creative effect. The 
      (now) highly recognisable tonal mangling occurs when the pitch correction 
      speed is set too fast for the audio that it is processing and it became 
      one of the most over-used production effects of the following years.</P>
      <P class=smallredtext>In February 1999, when this <EM>Sound On Sound</EM> 
      article was published, the producers of this recording were apparently so 
      keen to maintain their 'trade secret' process that they were willing to 
      attribute the effect to the (then) recently-released Digitech Talker 
      vocoder pedal. As most people are now all-too familiar with the 'Cher 
      effect', as it became known, we have maintained the article in its 
      original form as an interesting historical footnote.</P></DIV>

      <P><FONT face=arial,helvetica><B>Striking It Lucky</B></FONT></P></CENTER>
      <P><FONT face=arial,helvetica>Together, Mark &amp; Brian run Metro 
      Productions, a production and publishing company which operates from 
      Dreamhouse, a three-studio complex in Kingston, Surrey. According to Mark, 
      despite the track's mainstream commercial success, the story behind the 
      creation of 'Believe' is a strange one. As released, the single 
      incorporates the work of six different songwriters, two producers and 
      executive producer Rob Dickins, the erstwhile chairman of Warner Brothers, 
      who has now left the company for pastures new.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT face=arial,helvetica>Mark, whose previous production credits 
      include Gina G and Danni Minogue, says the fact that the single happened 
      at all is down to a series of lucky breaks, which began when Metro's 
      songwriters were asked by Rob Dickins to submit a song for possible 
      inclusion on Cher's new album.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT face=arial,helvetica>He explains, "Thanks to the work we had done 
      with Gina and Danni for Warners, we had a good relationship with Rob, and 
      that's why we got the opportunity to work with Cher. Rob asked us to write 
      a song and we came up with the song 'Dov'é L'Amore' [now a track on Cher's 
      new album, also entitled <I>Believe</I>]. Initially, he wanted Junior 
      Vasquez to produce it, which we were delighted about, because it was quite 
      a coup to have the song accepted in the first place."</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT face=arial,helvetica>'Dov'é L'Amore' was duly sent over to 
      Vasquez in New York, but when he sent back his version, it was rejected by 
      Rob, who decided instead to give the production of the track to Taylor and 
      Rawling as well.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT face=arial,helvetica>"It was one of those scenarios where lucky 
      breaks, chance and other people's bad luck come into play," says Mark. "We 
      were only meant to do one song, but in the end we were responsible for the 
      bulk of the <I>Believe</I> album -- six tracks in total including 
      'Believe' itself. Vasquez did another and producer Todd Terry did 
      three."</FONT></P>
      <CENTER>
      <P><FONT face=arial,helvetica><B>The 'Believe' Balancing 
      Act</B></FONT></P></CENTER>
      <P><FONT face=arial,helvetica>The starting point for 'Believe' was a song 
      by Brian Higgins, Matt Gray, Stuart McLennen and Tim Powell, which had 
      been knocking around the Warner offices in demo form for months. "Everyone 
      loved the chorus 
      <TABLE cellSpacing=8 cellPadding=1 width="40%" align=left border=0>
        <TBODY>
        <TR>
          <TD align=left width="30%">
            <DIV align=right><FONT face=arial,helvetica size=5>"I used four 
            different kick samples from my own collection playing together. One 
            was just a noise, one was a splat, one had all the bottom end and so 
            on."</FONT></DIV></TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE>
<p>but not the rest of the song," 
      says Mark. "As we were already writing other songs for Cher, Rob asked us 
      if we could sort it out. Two of our writers, Steve Torch and Paul Barry, 
      got involved and eventually came up with a complete song that Rob and Cher 
      were happy with."</FONT></p>
<p></p>
      <P><FONT face=arial,helvetica>Mark says Torch and Barry were given a DAT 
      with a programmed demo in a firmly eurobeat style, which they weren't too 
      keen on, so they sat down with guitars and began to rewrite it. In the 
      end, they kept only the chorus, which went through some minor chord 
      changes but basically remained intact. "The lyrics for the chorus were 
      already there, but our guys added the lyrics, melody and chords for the 
      verses and middle eight, then put the whole thing back together again. We 
      sent it over to Rob Dickins and he highlighted a few changes. Then Cher 
      heard it and she liked it straight away."</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT face=arial,helvetica>Once the demo version was agreed, Mark and 
      Brian took over for the actual production, working at Dreamhouse, which 
      has Mackie consoles in every room. Mark says, "We knew the rough direction 
      to take, because Rob had said he wanted to make a Cher dance record. The 
      hard part was trying to make one that wouldn't alienate Cher's existing 
      fans. We couldn't afford to have anyone say 'I hate this because it's 
      dance' -- then we would have turned off loads of people who are used to 
      hearing Cher do rock ballads and MOR songs. I think we can safely say we 
      succeeded in maintaining the balance, because kids on their own will buy a 
      certain type of record, and adults on their own will buy another. The only 
      way you can achieve sales of 1.5 million is to appeal to both camps. 
      Getting that right was the most difficult part -- and was the reason why I 
      ended up doing the track twice!"</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT face=arial,helvetica>Mark got halfway through the first version 
      before consigning it to the bin without having played it to anyone else. 
      "It was just too hardcore dance -- it wasn't happening," he says. "I 
      scrapped it and started again, because I realised it needed a sound that 
      was unusual, but not in a typical dance record sort of way. This was 
      tricky, because dance music is very specific. To get what I was after I 
      had to think about each sound very carefully, so that the sound itself was 
      dance-based but not obviously so.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT face=arial,helvetica>"It was really a question of finding, say, a 
      kick drum that didn't sound like a typical TR909 dance kick drum -- and 
      instead, using something that had the right sound but wasn't so 
      <I>clichéd</I>. I ended up using all kinds of sounds mixed together. The 
      drums are all samples, but samples that have been mutated, EQ'd and 
      compressed. The kick drums in particular were heavily compressed to give 
      them a weird, pumping, smacky sound."</FONT></P>
      <CENTER>
      <P><FONT face=arial,helvetica><B>Instrumentation</B></FONT></P></CENTER>
      <P><FONT face=arial,helvetica>Mark believes one doesn't need expensive 
      technology in order to make a hit record, and adds that 'Believe' 
      exemplifies this philosophy. "Don't forget I was only using a Mackie desk, 
      and the rest of the equipment involved was the sort of thing any <I>Sound 
      On Sound</I> reader could aspire to. Having a really expensive piece of 
      kit doesn't mean you'll make hit records. My view is that the end result 
      is what matters -- not how you get there."</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT face=arial,helvetica>With this attitude, it's not so surprising 
      that Mark used nothing fancier than <I>Cubase VST</I> on a Mac G3 to 
      assemble the entire track, including the vocals (although these were 
      initially recorded to Tascam DA88s -- <IMG height=166 
      src="Recording%20Cher's%20'Believe'_files/trackscher1.gif" width=240 
      align=right>see below). The G3 contains a Korg 1212 I/O card, but in fact 
      a stand-alone Soundscape converter unit provides the main audio 
      interfacing with the rest of the Metro kit, particularly their DA88s (via 
      TDIF). "The sampler was an Akai S3000, and for other sounds we used 
      several of our synths, including the Clavia Nord Rack, Oberheim Matrix 
      1000 -- for the white-noise wind effect at the very beginning of the track 
      -- and the Moog Progidy for some sub-bass. A lot of the time I was just 
      fiddling around to see what came out! The samples were a combination of 
      sample CDs and ones I've collected myself over the years. As I've said, I 
      wanted the samples to sound different, so that the track didn't sound like 
      any old dance hit. We did this by using the EQ in the Akai sampler, from 
      our little ART Tube EQ and on the desk to really crunch things up, and 
      compressing and squashing sounds to give them an unusual edge. The great 
      thing about the S3000 is that you can put four different samples on each 
      note in a keygroup -- so for the kick drum, for example, I used four 
      different kick samples from my own collection playing together. One was 
      just a noise, one was a splat, one had all the bottom end and so on. By 
      mixing everything together I was able to create something 
      unique."</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT face=arial,helvetica>Cher's vocals were recorded onto three 
      Tascam DA88s with a Neumann U67, at her suggestion, as she had just 
      finished a recording with George Martin using that mic and was 
      particularly pleased with the results. From the DA88, the vocals were 
      loaded straight into <I>Cubase VST</I> on the Mac, and nearly everything 
      else was then done on the computer's hard disk. Mark: "There's also some 
      guitar in the chorus, which we ran through a Sessionette amp miked with an 
      AKG C414. Then we put it through a Zoom to add tremolo and severely EQ'd 
      it to make it sound a bit odd. For the piano we used an Emu Vintage Keys 
      sound which I really like. It's based on a Yamaha CP80 electric piano 
      which we slightly modified to make it cut through the track better. Then 
      we compressed it quite hard to give it a definite ringing sound. We also 
      added lots of delay using a Roland SDE330, which sounds really spacious 
      and adds ambience without cluttering the track -- although the really 
      obvious delay on the vocal phrase 'after love, after love' at the very 
      beginning wasn't done using that -- we just sampled that phrase and 
      repeated it with the S3000's internal filter on it, so that it fades in 
      very dull and brightens up."</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT face=arial,helvetica>Mark explains that the main synth pad 
      remained the same throughout the recording of the track, and was the only 
      element that survived from his first version. "It's a very distinctive, 
      core part of the record -- the song hinges on it. I combined two sounds to 
      get that -- one from my old Roland Juno 106 and another from the Korg 
      TR-Rack. There is something about the way the pad and melody work together 
      that gives the whole track a sort of hanging feeling. When I started 
      putting the song together for the second time, I had the pad running, and 
      I rebuilt the drums to make the pad and the drums sound like they were 
      driving everything along. Then I added the other instrumentation -- the 
      guitar and the piano."</FONT></P>
      <CENTER>
      <P><FONT face=arial,helvetica><B>That Vocal Trick In 
      Full</B></FONT></P></CENTER>
      <P><FONT face=arial,helvetica>Everyone who hears 'Believe' immediately 
      comments on the vocals, which are unusual, to say the least. Mark says 
      that for him, this was the most nerve-racking part of the project, because 
      he wasn't sure what Cher would say when she heard what he'd done to her 
      voice. For those who've been wondering, yes -- it's basically down to 
      vocoding and filtering (for more on vocoders and the theory behind them, 
      see the Power Vocoding workshop in <I>SOS</I> January '94).</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT face=arial,helvetica>Mark: "It all began with a Korg VC10, which 
      is a very rare, very groovy-looking analogue vocoder from the '70s, with a 
      built-in synth, a little keyboard and a microphone stuck on top", he 
      enthuses. "You must mention this, because <I>SOS</I> readers will love it 
      -- and I know, because I've been reading the mag for years!</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT face=arial,helvetica>"Anyway, the Korg VC10 looks bizarre, but 
      it's great to use if you want to get vocoder effects up and running 
      straight away. You just play the keyboard to provide a vocoder carrier 
      signal, sing into the microphone to produce the modulator signal, and off 
      you go. The only drawback is the synth -- you can't do anything to change 
      the sound, so the effects you can produce are rather limited.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT face=arial,helvetica>"I played around with the vocals and 
      realised that the vocoder effect could work, but not with the Korg -- the 
      results just weren't clear enough. So instead, I used a Digitech Talker -- 
      a reasonably new piece of kit that looks like an old guitar foot pedal, 
      which I suspect is what it was originally designed for [<I>see review in 
      SOS <A href="http://www.soundonsound.com/" target=_top><IMG height=203 
      src="Recording%20Cher's%20'Believe'_files/chercd.gif" width=240 align=left 
      border=0></A>April '98</I>]. You plug your mic straight into it, and it 
      gives you a vocoder-like effect, but with clarity; it almost sounds like 
      you've got the original voice coming out the other end. I used a tone from 
      the Nord Rack as a carrier signal and sequenced the notes the Nord was 
      playing from <I>Cubase</I> to follow Cher's vocal melody. That gave the 
      vocals that 'stepped' quality that you can hear prominently throughout the 
      track -- but only when I shifted the the Nord's notes back a bit. For some 
      reason, if you track the vocal melody exactly, with the same notes 
      <I>and</I> timing, you hardly get get any audible vocoded effect. But I 
      was messing about with the Nord melody sequence in Cubase and shifted all 
      the notes back a fraction with respect to the vocal. Then you really 
      started to hear it, although even then it was a bit hit-and-miss -- I had 
      to experiment with the timing of each of the notes in the Nord melody 
      sequence to get the best effect. You couldn't hear an effect on all the 
      vocals by any means -- and on others it made the words completely 
      impossible to understand!</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT face=arial,helvetica>"In the end, we only used vocoded sections 
      where they had the most striking effect, but didn't make the lyrics 
      unintelligible. To do that, I had to keep the vocoded bits very short. So 
      for example, when Cher sang 'Do you believe in life after love?', I think 
      I only cut the processed vocals into the phrase on just the syllables 
      'belie-' from 'believe' and 'lo-' from 'love' -- but that was enough to 
      make the whole phrase sound really arresting. I made sure throughout that 
      the last word of each vocal phrase was unprocessed, because again, I found 
      it sounded too bubbly and hard to understand when it was 
      vocoded."</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT face=arial,helvetica>Mark spent time alone in the studio 
      painstakingly processing Cher's vocals in this way, and by the following 
      morning, he was convinced he didn't have the nerve to play her what he'd 
      done. "It was a bit radical," he laughs. "Basically, it was the 
      destruction of her voice, so I was really nervous about playing it to her! 
      In the end, I just thought it sounded so good, I had to at least let her 
      hear it -- so I hit Play. She was fantastic -- she just said 'it sounds 
      <I>great</I>!', so the effect stayed. I was amazed by her reaction, and so 
      excited, because I knew it was good."</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT face=arial,helvetica>Although the vocoder effect was Mark's idea, 
      the other obvious vocal effect in 'Believe' is the 'telephoney' quality of 
      Cher's vocal throughout. This idea came from the lady herself -- she'd 
      identified something similar on a Roachford record and asked Mark if he 
      could reproduce it.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT face=arial,helvetica>He explains, "Roachford uses a restricted 
      bandwidth, and filters the vocals heavily so that the top and bottom ends 
      are wound off and the whole vocal is slightly distorted. It took a while 
      to work out exactly what it was that Cher liked about this particular 
      Roachford song, but in the end we realised it was the 'telephoney' sound. 
      I used the filter section on my Drawmer DS404 gate on the vocal before it 
      went into the Talker to get that effect."</FONT></P>
      <CENTER>
      <P><FONT face=arial,helvetica><B>Better 'Believe' 
      It...</B></FONT></P></CENTER>
      <P><FONT face=arial,helvetica>'Believe' took approximately 10 days to 
      record. Once it was completed, Mark ran a monitor mix onto DAT and sent it 
      to Rob Dickins for clearance. To Mark's surprise, Rob was so pleased with 
      the sound that the monitor mix basically became the final version, with 
      only the most minor of tweaks. "The vocals were much too loud, because I 
      was trying to clear the track," he laughs. "But apart from that, it worked 
      fine, and everyone was really happy with it. It just goes to show that you 
      don't need to spend days mixing in order to

            only used vocoded sections where they had the most striking effect, 
            but didn't make the lyrics unintelligible. To do that, I had to keep 
            the vocoded bits very short."</FONT></TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE>
<p>get a hit. 
      With 'Believe', I was adjusting things as I went along and running 
      everything live on the computer, which meant I could save just about 
      everything, apart from the effects and EQ hooked up to the desk. All the 
      level changes in the mix were already recorded in the sequencer, so the 
      finished mix just kind of grew in an organic way as we worked on the 
      track."</FONT></p>
<p></p>
      <P><FONT face=arial,helvetica>The single was mastered at Townhouse, 
      although very little was actually changed at this stage. "It was very 
      straightforward," says Mark. "Just the fades and the odd dB of cut and 
      boost here and there -- standard mastering stuff."</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT face=arial,helvetica>Looking back, Mark says the most satisfying 
      part of the project was getting to know Cher who spent six weeks at the 
      studio working on the album. "The first day was incredibly nerve-racking," 
      he admits. "I thought she might think our setup was a bit small, and that 
      she would turn out to be a bit 'Hollywood'. But she was really great and 
      easy to get on with. These days, artists like Cher are used to working 
      with producers who have their own studios -- and these are not necessarily 
      big, just well equipped." </FONT></P>
      <P><FONT face=arial,helvetica>With such a massive hit to their credit, 
      it's not surprising that the eight-man team at Metro is now in great 
      demand. They are currently finishing a Gypsy Kings album (which was 
      started after the group guested on the 'Dov'é L'Amore' track), and other 
      high-profile projects are in the pipeline, such as the first single from 
      Gary Barlow's new solo album, and the next Tamperer release. Whether they 
      will continue their relationship with Cher, however, remains to be 
      seen.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT face=arial,helvetica>"She's said she wants to work with us again, 
      but you know how record company politics can be," says Mark. "I hope it 
      does happen, because it was a great project and one we all thoroughly 
      enjoyed. We certainly never expected the single to do so well -- let alone 
      seven weeks at number one. But when I listen to it now I can see why it 
      worked. It's a great song with a fantastic chorus, and the weird vocoder 
      effect on the vocals makes it special." </FONT></P>
